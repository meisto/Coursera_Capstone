## Data sources:
This is a list of all the data and how I want to use it to solve my problem. Note that many of the data sources are in German. I will add a short translation where necessary for your convenience.

### Foursquare Places API
[Foursquare API](https://foursquare.com/) - This has been discussed previously in the course, therefore I will not go further into details here.
### VVS list of stops
 [VVS list of stops](https://www.openvvs.de/dataset/haltestellen/resource/d87d1f01-5c14-4d08-8452-e405a6472ab4) - A list of all stops in the VVS (Verkehrsverbund Stuttgart; responsible for public transport in the region of Stuttgart) with additional data such as geographic position.
I will use the data for geo location data, type of transport filtering and public transport lines from this data set.
